Password manager with [age encryption](https://age-encryption.org/).

This is a fork of [passage](https://github.com/stchris/passage) by [strchris](https://github.com/stchris) since it is no longer maintained and I enjoyed using it. It was also a good excuse for me to start digging into rust. Note that I've renamed the tool `page`, given that the author of [age](https://age-encryption.org/) has released a popular altnerative to the [password-store](https://www.passwordstore.org/), which is also called [passage](https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage). `page` is a work in process.
